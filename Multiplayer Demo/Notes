Basic Info:

RPC is used to call scripts to run in a synchronized way on a server and the clients
example use: a rocket explodes, the animation should be played to everyone so an rpc call would be used for this

Network/Synced variables are used to keep data updated between server and clients
example use: a player switches team, all the clients variables related to who is on their team should change to reflect that

Command line way to start a game with a specific role: [build path to .exe] -mlapi [server, client, or host]

Player prefab refers to the prefab that will be client controlled when a client connects to a server, this needs to be added to network manager

network manager is the hub where everything else connects, just create a network manager object in the scene

Things to research:
Hosting over internet, so far have only done connections from the same computer
Matchmaking solutions
